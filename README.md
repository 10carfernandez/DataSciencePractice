# DataSciencePractice
These are some data science and machine learning algorithms I have written by hand in order to get a better understanding for what is actually being done "under the hood." So far, the following algorithms (which are not perfect, but get the point across) are what I have done so far:
1. K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
